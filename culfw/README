License: GPL v2

These gadgets all feature one or more CC1101 transceiver and an Atmel MCU, so
the can be used for low-power wireless communication in the 868 band.

- The CUL (CC110x USB Light) has one CC1101 and an AT90USB162 MCU.
  See http://busware.de/tiki-index.php?page=CUL for details and on how to buy
  it.

- The CUR (CC110x USB Remote) is a device with following features: CC1101 /
  AT90USB646 / 16Mbit flash / 128x128 color display / 5-way jogdial / Battery.

- The CUN (CC110x USB Network) is a device with following features: CC1101 /
  AT90USB1287 / Ethernet interface / 16Mbit flash / 256Kbit SRAM / MicroSD


This firmware makes it possible to use these devices with fhem. Right now the
following device families are supported:
- FS20
- FHT
- EM
- KS300/S300TH
- HMS

Thanks to the MyUSB project (http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/MyUSB.php, ) the
device/firmware combination confirms to the Universal Serial Bus Communication
Device Class Abstract Control Model (USB CDC ACM) specification, so it can be
used out of the box with a lot of operating systems. 


Prerequisites
=============
  You'll need following packets to install the firmware (in paranthesis is the
  version of the corresponding packet for my installation):
  - dfu-programmer (0.4.4)

  If you want to modify the firmware:
  - avr-libc       (1.6.2)
  - binutils-avr   (2.18)
  - gcc-avr        (4.3.0)


Compile (optional)
==================
  Change into your device directory (e.g. Devices/CUL)
  Type "make", which will output text like:
    Compiling C: CUL.c
    [...]


Install / Flash the firmware
============================
  Change into your device directory (e.g. CUL)
  - CUL: Insert the USB-Stick while pressing the micro-switch.
  - CUR: Remove Battery/USB. Put the device on a table with the jogdial facing
         down. Press the case, until you hear the jogdial is pressed. Insert
         the battery, then the USB-Cable.

  A USB device "03eb:2ffa Atmel Corp." should appear.
  Now execute "make usbprogram", which will output text like:
    dfu-programmer at90usb162 erase
    dfu-programmer at90usb162 flash CUL.hex
    Validating...
    6312 bytes used (51.37%)
    dfu-programmer at90usb162 start
  The last command will reset the device, a new USB device should appear:
  "03eb:204b Atmel Corp.". If not try to reinsert the CUL without pressing
  the micro-switch.

Quick Test:
===========
  Linux
  =====
    Hopefully you see a device /dev/ttyACM0 (if you use a newer kernel, which
    loads the cdc_acm kernel module), or a /dev/ttyUSB0 (if your kernel uses
    usbserial). For usbserial kernel you may need to add the module options
    "usbserial vendor=0x03eb product=0x204b" to modprobe.conf.

    Connect to the device e.g. with "screen /dev/ttyACM0".

  Windows
  =======
    Install a virtual COM port, use MyUSB_USBtoSerial.inf from the docs
    directory. Locate the COM-port in the device manager shown as
    "USB Virtual Serial Port (COMx)". Start Hyperterminal, open a connection
    to COMx 9600,8,n,1.

  Type "V<return>". The string "V 1.0..." should appear. Type X01<return> to
  enable the data reporting.


Protocol
=========
  The data is readable ASCII with cr/nl as a message terminator.

  PC -> CUL:
  ----------
    The first byte is the command (case significant), the rest ist a hex string
    (case insignificant), non-hex characters will be ignored, you can insert
    spaces for aesthetic.  Commands are _not_ echoed.
    Following commands are supported:

    a<XX>[<YY>]
     (CUR only)
     If no YY is specified:
     - Display the battery state:
       XX = 01  raw reading
       XX = 00  reading transformed into %, taking nonlinearity into account
     If both XX and YY is specified (CURV3 only):
       XX = 00  Charge with 500mA (YY=01) or 100mA (YY=00)
       XX = 01  Disable USB charging (YY=01) or enable it (YY=00)

    B<hex>
      Reboot device.
      If <hex> is not 00 enter bootloader mode

    C<reg>
      <reg> is a (two digit) hex number: return the value of the cc1101
      register
      Example: C35 -> C35 = 0x0D / 13

    c<hex>
      (CUR/CUN )
      Read/set the clock: either the RTC chip (CUR only) or the internal NTP
      counter (CUN only). If hex is 01, then display the date, if it is 02 the
      time, if it is 03, then both date and time. If the length of hex is 6,
      then the RTC will be set to YYMMDDHHmmSS. Data is written BCD, i.e
      December is written as 12 and not as 0C. The RTC version of the clock
      may be set partially: if hex is 6 characters long (converted to 3 bytes)
      then only the time part will be set. This is not applicable to NTP.

    d<hex>data
      (CUR only)
      Choose the sub-function with the first two bytes (hex):
      - FF: LCD control, the next 3 bytes (6 chars) are:
        - LCD on (01) / on+cls (02) / off (00) / don't change (FF)
        - contrast: set directly (00-FE) / read from eeprom (FC) /
                    increase (FE) / decrease (FD) / don't change (FF)
        - brightness: set directly (00-FE) / read from eeprom (FC) /
                    increase (FE) / decrease (FD) / don't change (FF)
      - 00: Set the title to the string following the 00
      - 01-08: Set the "body" lines 01-08 the the text
      - 09/0A: Insert a new line at the bottom/top of the screen,
               scrolling the rest.

    E<x> eth debugging
      (CUN only)
      - c
        Print out the currently configured IP & MAC Adress.

      - d
        increae debug level. Meaning of the levels
        1: application debugging, e.g. the NTP module will display the time
        2: print ETH header (mac adress + ETH frametype)
        3: dump whole ethernet packet.

      - i
        Reinitialize the ethernet subsystem, restart DHCP & NTP

      - n
        Request an NTP update


    e (eeprom) factory reset
      - resets all eeprom values. A reboot is required to activate the
        changes.

    f<type>[<data>] (experimental rf txmit via cc1101 packet handling)
      Send data: fs<data>, e.g. fsHallo
      Receive data: fr (fHallo will be displayed on reception)
      Reset: X21

    F<hex>
      Send out an FS20 message. <hex> is a hex string of the following form:
      hhhhaacc or hhhhaaccee, where 
      - hhhh is the FS20 housecode, 
      - aa is the FS20 device address, 
      - cc is the FS20 command
      - ee is the FS20 timespec. Note that cc must have the extension bit set.
      Example: F12340111

    l<hex>
      Set the led mode.
      - 00: Set LED off
      - 01: Set LED on
      - 02: The LED will blink once a second

    P<hex><filename>
      (CUR only)
      Display a picture. The hex part consists of 4 bytes (x,y,w,h), and the
      file contains the data in a 12bit per pixel format. Use
      fonts/pgm2fourbit.pl with the raw option to convert raw PPM files into
      the needed format, and tools/cur_file.pl to upload the file

    R<AA> or R<AAAA>
      Read eeprom (i.e. "saved configuration") byte. Arguments: one or two
      byte hex address <AA> or <AAAA>
      Adress-Slots:
      - 0x00 - 0x01
        Eeprom magic bytes
      - 0x02 - 0x2A
        Configuration registers as described in the "Table 37: "SPI Address
        space" of the CC1101 datasheet (Version SWRS061C).  Note: all EEPROM
        Values have an offset of 2.
      - 0x2B - 0x32
        CC1101 PA Table (8 bytes).
      See fncollection.h for more details.
      Example: R00 -> 63

      For the additional CUN-only see the corresponding W (write eeprom) section.

    r<filename>
      (CUR/CUN)
      output the file name <filename>. First the length of the file,
      (hex 8 byte+nl) is written to the output, then the body of the file.
      Use "." as filename to get a listing of the current files with length.
      Use the program cur_file from the tools directory to read a file, e.g.:
        perl cur_file.pl -r MENU /dev/ttyACM0
      NOTE: No fhem/screen must be connected to the CUR while reading/writing

    s<hex>
      (CUR only)
      sleeptime. Switch everything off after <hex> seconds of joystick
      inactivity. An instant sleep is achieved by pressing the joystick.
      00 disables sleep.
      If the CUR is connected via USB then only the display will be switched
      off.

    T<hex>
      Send out an FHT message.  Special control commands:
      - T01<CCCC>
        Set the "own" housecode to CCCC. The first byte will be used as the FHZ
        code in in FHT80b mode. This command will also clear all buffers.
      - T01
        Return the own housecode (hex)
      - T02
        Return the FHT80b buffer. FHT80b commands are queued in an internal
        buffer, which has place for 14 to 31 messages.
      - T03
        Return the size of the remaining fht buffer (in bytes).
      - T04<sec>
        Set the internal second counter to <second>. Used by fhem to
        synchronize the culfw seconds with the PC before sending the
        hour/minute command to the fht.
        
    t
      Output the time since boot (uptime). The output has the following form: 
      DDD HH:MM:SS
      Example: t -> 000 00:00:07

    V
      Print the firmware version.
      Example: V -> V 1.28 CUL868


    W<AA><DD> or W<AAAA><DD>
      Write eeprom byte.  Arguments: one or two-byte hex address <AAAA>
      followed by one byte hex data <DD>. See R above for address (AAAA)
      explanation.
      Example: W1D06

      Additional CUN-only commands:
        Wim - MAC Address
        Wid - DHCP enabled flag
        Wia - IPV4 Address
        Wig - IPV4 gateway
        Win - IPV4 network mask
        Wip - tcplink port
        WiN - NTP sever
        Wio - GMT offset
        Notes:
        - Factory reset: DHCP, tcplink:2323, NTP-Server = Router, GMT:0
        - Everything becomes active only after a reboot.
        - MAC adress is written as hex, with optional semicolon
        - IP4 adresses are written in decimal with dot separator
        - port is written in decimal
        - if the NTP server is 0.0.0.0 (default), then the router is used as
          an NTP server.
        - the GMT offset is specified as a hex number, and is a signed value:
          ff==-1, fe==-2, etc
        - factory reset will re-initialize this data, with a unique MAC address
        - If DHCP is enabled, the left (orange RX/TX) led blinks till a valid
          DHCP adress is received.
        Example:
          Wim01:02:03:04:05:06
          Wia192.168.0.1
          Wio02


    w<length><filename>
      (CUR only)
      write the file named <filename>. Length is hex, 8 bytes.
      The command must be followed by length bytes of data, which will be
      written to the local file.  If length is FFFFFFFF, then the file will be
      deleted.
      Use the program cur_file.pl from the tools directory to write a file, e.g.:
        perl cur_file.pl -w MENU /dev/ttyACM0
      NOTE: _NO_ fhem/screen must be connected to the CUR while reading/writing


    X<RR> Enable data reporting.
      <RR> is a one-byte hex value, with following bits (bit 0 is the LSB bit):
      - Bit 0: Report known messages (parity & checksum ok), with type prefix.
      - Bit 1: Report each of the (repeated) packets of a message
      - Bit 2: Report detailed data, even with wrong parity / checksum.
      - Bit 3: Monitor mode: output an r/s/t/u on a risings edge (the letter
               depends on the internal state), g/h/i on a falling edge
      - Bit 4: Timing: in monitor mode output two additional bytes (high byte,
               low byte) of the internal microsecond timer. This is binary!
      - Bit 5: RSSI: report RSSI value as an additional HEX byte after digested
               data or as a separate byte if Bit 3 is set too.
      - Bit 6: Report FHT protocol messages (ack, etc)

      Note: 00 disables radio reception, any other value initialize the radio
      chip and enable reception.
      Default is 00: do not report anything, radio chip uninitialized.
      Example: X01

      If <RR> is not specified, report the current value.

    x<pp> Change PA tables.
      <pp> is a one-byte hex value, valid values are 00 to 09, with following
      values: the first 5 is -10/-5/0/5/10 dBm with PA ramping, the next 5 is
      the same without PA ramping. If the value is outside this spec, then the
      0dBm variant (02) will be used.
      Example: x03

    q
      Exit shell (CUN only)

    Unknown commands
      Prints the "help", the list of supported commands
      Example:
        ? -> ?? B C F R V W X


  CUL -> PC:
  ----------
    The CUL reports following data (as a HEX string, uppercase):

    For FS20:
      Fhhhhaacc or Fhhhhaaccee, explanation see above.
    For FHT:
      ThhhhNNNNNN
    For EM:
      Ettaacc111122223333
        tt:type 01=EM-1000s, 02=EM-100-EM, 03=1000GZ
        aa:address, depending on the type above 01:01-04, 02:05-08, 03:09-12
        cc:counter, will be incremented by one for each message
        1111: cumulated value
        2222: last value (Not set for type 2)
        3333: top value  (Not set for type 2)
    For KS300:
      KFFTTTHWHWWRRFR
        Data must be read backwards
    For S300TH:
      KaaTTHTHH
        Data must be read backwards
    For HMS:
      Hxxxxxxxxxxxx
    For Hoermann Garage door openers:
      Rxxxxx
        Note: this protocol is not really understood.

    If bit 3 in the X command is set, then report raw data, even if it has a
    wrong checksum or parity
      b State Nzero NAvg Nsync Nbyte Nbit [RSSI] NNNNNNNN
        State  State of the rise-rise (4bit) and rise-fall (4bit) machines (hex)
        Nzero  time for the zero bit
        Navg   time for (zero+one)/2
        Nsync  Number of 0 sync bits
        Nbyte  Next byteidx to write
        Nbit   Next bit to write
        RSSI   RSSI, if the RSSI bit is set, see X cmd


  CUR Menu
  --------
    To define a menu on the CUR, follow this HOWTO:
    - create a fhem xml-list with
        fhem.pl fhemhost:7072 xmllist > fhem.xmllist
    - convert the template and the fhem listing into a CUR MENU file:
        perl xmllist2curmenu.pl fhem.xmllist CUR.menu.template > MENU
    - write the MENU file to the CUR:
        perl cur_file.pl -w MENU /dev/ttyACM0
      NOTE: The CUR must be in the X00 mode (default after reboot), and no
      fhem/screen should be connected to it.

    - switch the CUR display on by pressing the joystick.
    - To have a nice logo on the first screen, upload it to the CUR:
        cd fonts
        perl ../tools/cur_file.pl -w house2_58x60  /dev/ttyACM0

Notes
=====

- 1% LIMIT
  The firmware respects the 1% limit for this band, so only 128 messages per
  hour will be sent. The counter has a minute resolution.

- Repeat-filter
  The FS20 protocol sends each message 3 times. The firmware filters optionally
  (See Command X bit 3) repeated messages.

- cc1100 settings. See cc1100.h / official PDF from TI  for details.

  - Change receiver sensitivity / target amplitude

    AGCCTRL2 (0x1B), bits 2:0, target amplitude:
      0:24dB, 1:27dB, 2:30dB, 3:33dB, 4:36dB, 5:38dB, 6:40dB, 7:42dB
      Default value: C1B -> 07 (42dB).

    AGCCTRL0 (0x1D), bits 1:0, decision boundery
      0:4dB, 1:8dB, 2:12dB, 3:16dB
      Default value: C1D -> 91 (8db)

    Example: W1D06
    Note: R/W address = C+2

  - Change frequency 
     FREQ2(0D), FREQ1(0E), FREQ0(0F), Fosc = 26MHz
     Fcarrier = Fosc/65536*(FREQ2.FREQ1.FREQ0)

     Example: W0F21, W1065, W11E8 (868.35MHz, default)
              W0F21, W1062, W1176 (868.00MHz)
    Note: R/W address = C+2

  - Change channel bandwidth 
    MDMCFG4 (10). CHANBW_E (bits 7:6), CHANBW_M (bits 5:4)
    BWchannel =  Fosc/(8 * (4+CHANBW_M) * 2 ^ CHANBW_E)
    Example: W1255 (325KHz, default)
             W1245 (406KHz)
             W1235 (464KHz)
    Note: R/W address = C+2

  - Read-Only-Registers:
    RSSI:    : C34 -> 217 (217-256-74 = -113 dBm)
    MARCSTATE: C35 -> 01 (Idle), 13 (RX)
