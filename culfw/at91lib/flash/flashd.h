/// \unit
///
/// !Purpose
///
/// The goal of FLASHD driver is to provide support for ATMEL Embedded Flash
/// devices. The FLASHD driver provides the unified interface of functions
/// and operations for all supported Embedded Flash Memory Devices. The driver
/// accesses the Flash memory by calling the low-level code which provided in 
/// EFC(EEFC) peripheral,o users do not have to concern themselves with the 
/// details of the special command sequences.  
///
/// !Usage
///
/// -# Initializes the %flash driver with FLASHD_Initialize().
/// -# Provide all neccessary operations such as %flash write, erase, lock, 
///    unlock, and set/clear GPNVM.
///    - They are able to check function arguments, address boundary etc.
///    - All %flash address argument is the unique address, as the result,
///      user no need to take care about the address is in which EFC, 
///      in which page and in which lock region for difference Flash device,
///      so that can help develop your uppon appcations with maximum efficiency.
/// -# Writes data in embedded %flash using FLASHD_Write().
/// -# Erase data in embedded %flash using FLASHD_Write().
/// -# Lock region in embedded %flash using FLASHD_Lock().
/// -# Unlock region in embedded %flash using FLASHD_Unlock().
/// -# Set GPNVM in embedded %flash using FLASHD_SetGPNVM().
/// -# Clear GPNVM in embedded %flash using FLASHD_ClearGPNVM().
///
/// !See also
///    - efc: EFC peripheral interface.
///    - eefc: EEFC peripheral interface.
