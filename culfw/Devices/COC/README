COC is an extesion for Raspberry Pi with a CSM radio interface.

FLASHING FIRMWARE

To update CSMs firmware with culfw execute:

	make 

Then, depending on yr version do:

	make program_full
or
	make program_radio_only

on the RPi itself. This will require some tools installed upfront. 
Use:

	apt-get install make avrdude


to flash the recompiled hex-file.

BEFORE

To use the serial port @ RPi you need to free it form other tasks as:

* console in /etc/inittab
* debugging stuff - edit /boot/cmdline.txt

reboot when done!

USING

The culfw stack is available as: 

define CSM CUL /dev/ttyAMA0@38400 1234

BE AWARE

The board introduces a I2C-multimaster. This means the RTC-, OneWire- 
and Flash chip are sharing the same I2C bus. This will allow the board 
and the RPi to access those resources.
