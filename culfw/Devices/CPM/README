----------
1. SUMMARY
----------

This CPM Tiny Action Framework is intended to ease the development of firmware
for the CPM module from busware (see
http://www.busware.de/tiki-index.php?page=CPM).

It is for simple boards with one switch (key), one LED, and one or more inputs.
The programmer only has to 
1) specify the pinning and 
2) fill in some code for the event handlers (actions). 
There are actions available for notification of pin changes, key presses (short
or long), and timeouts.

----------
2. CREDITS
----------

This work is a merger of several prio firmware projects from Dirk Tostmann,
Boris Neubert and Maz Rashid and Rudolf König. For instance see CPM-BS and
CPM-Gardenabodenfeuchtesensor.

3. DEVELOPMENT
--------------

--- A. STARTING A NEW PROJECT

1. Create a directory below CPM.
2. Copy the files from template to that directory.
3. Rename the target in line 79 of the makefile. Do not touch the rest of the
   makefile.


--- B. FITTING board.h TO YOUR BOARD

It is assumed that your board has one user LED and one user switch (key).
Configure how they are connected to the CPM. Definitions start with LED_ and SW_
respectively.

In some designs, the user LED is connected to PA3. PA3 is also used for
communication between the ATTiny84 and the CC1100. Make sure not to switch the
LED on or off during reception or transmission as this breaks the communication.

MASK0 is used to enable the pin change interrupt. Please define the PCINTx for
the pins that should trigger an interrupt when changed.

WDCORR is the correction factor for the internal watchdog timer clock. In most
cases the watchdog triggers somewhat later than 8 seconds after power down.
705/600 is the multiplier to define how much longer it takes. Do not put in
brackets (see lib/util.c for the reason)!

CLOCKTIMEOUT is the time in seconds after which action_timeout is triggered.
NOTICE: The watchdog mechanism leads to fluctuations of about 5 to 10 seconds in
10 minutes. It cannot be used to precisely trigger an action after a specified
time.

KEYTIMEOUT is the time in milliseconds after which a key press is detected as a
long key press.

If USE_TIMER is defined the watchdog/powerdone mechanism is deactived and
instead a more precise internal timer interrupt driven clock mechanism is used.


--- C. WRITING THE CORE ROUTINES

Simply fill in the stubs in actions.c.

action_getconfig()	triggered once at firmware startup

action_timeout()	triggered when CLOCKTIMEOUT seconds have elapsed since
			the previous action

action_keypresshort()	triggered when the switch is pressed for less than
			KEYTIMEOUT milliseconds

action_keypresslong()	triggered when the switch is pressed for KEYTIMEOUT
			milliseconds or more

action_pinchanged()	triggered, when one of the input pins changed as defined
			in MASK0 (except for the one the switch is connected to
			since this is handled by the key press actions).


--- D. COMPILING AND FLASHING

It is strongly recommended to do a

  make clean

before the first compile because the library files could have been
compiled with different board settings recently.

Compile with 

  make 

and flash with 

  make program

For flashing, avrdude should be installed. Please have a look at the
avrdude-specific options in the makefile and adjust them to your needs.

--------------
4. DESCRIPTION
--------------

--- lib/main.c

Upon startup of the firmware, main() from lib/main.c is executed. It does some
initialization, makes the LED blink 5 times, and enters the main loop. The main
loop checks for key presses, pin changes and timeouts and triggers the
corresponding actions. If done, it sends the devices (MCU and CC1101) to sleep.
The MCU is woken by pin changes (including key presses) or by a timeout of the 8
second watchdog. 

--- lib/util.c

This file contains some utility functions that can be used in your project. The
most notable are:

void led_blink (uint8_t n): makes the LED blink as often as specified in the
argument

void fs20_sendCommand (uint16_t housecode, uint8_t button, uint8_t cmd): sends
an FS20 command

void fs20_sendValue (uint16_t housecode, uint8_t sensor, uint8_t flags, uint16_t
value): sends an FS20 value (sensor protocol)

An example for FS20 reception can be found in the SS project in
actions.c, function action_keypresslong().


---------------------
5. CONCLUDING REMARKS
---------------------

- See tools for helper programs. Documentation is in their source codes.
- It is worthwhile having a glance at the other projects.
- Project SS is an example how FS20 data for configuration of housecode and
  button can be received.
- You are encouraged to amend the CPM Tiny Action Framework, but make sure not to
  break existing projects.
