	--------------------------------------------
		* Fixed MIDI demo, now correctly waits for the endpoint to be ready between multiple note messages
		* Added CDC Host demo application
		* Added KeyboardFullInt demo application
		* Endpoint and Pipe creation routines now mask endpoint/pipe size with the size mask, to remove transaction
		  size bits not required for the routines (improves compatibility with devices)
		* Fixed AudioInput demo - now correctly sends sampled audio to the host PC
		* Shrunk round-robbin scheduler code slightly via the use of struct pointers rather than array indexes
		* Fixed off-by-one error when determining if the Usage Stack is full inside the HID Report parser
		* Renamed Magstripe.h to MagstripeHW.h and moved driver out of the library and into the MagStripe demo folder
		* Added preprocessor checks to enable C linkage on the library components when used with a C++ compiler
		* Added Still Image Host demo application
		* The USB device task now restores the previously selected endpoint, allowing control requests to be transparently
		  handled via interrupts while other endpoints are serviced through polling
		* Fixed device signature being sent in reverse order in the CDC bootloader
		* Host demos now have a seperate ConfigDescriptor.c/.h file for configuration descriptor processing
		* HostWithParser demos now have a seperate HIDReport.c/.h file for HID report processing and dumping

		  Unicode strings (prefixed with an L before the opening quotation mark) can be used instead of explicit arrays
		  of ASCII characters
		* Fixed Endpoint/Pipes being configured incorrectly if the maximum endpoint/pipe size for the selected USB AVR
		  model was given as the bank size

		* USB to Serial demo data endpoints changed to dual-banked 16 byte to allow the demo to work
		  on USB AVRs with limited USB FIFO RAM
		* Changed demo endpoint numbers to use endpoints 3 and 4 for double banking, to allow limited
		  USB device controller AVRs (AT90USB162, AT90USB82) to function correctly

		* USB_DEV_OPT_LOWSPEED option now works correctly
		* Added ability to set the USB options statically for a binary size reduction via the USE_STATIC_OPTIONS
		  compile time define
		* USB_Init no longer takes a Mode parameter if compiled for a USB device with no host mode option, or
		  if forced to a particular mode via the USB_HOST_ONLY or USB_DEVICE_ONLY compile time options
		* USB_Init no longer takes an Options parameter if options statically configured by USE_STATIC_OPTIONS
		* Endpoint_Ignore_* and Pipe_Ignore_* made smaller by making the dummy variable non-volatile so that the
		  compiler can throw away the result more efficiently
		* Added in an optional GroupID value to each scheduler entry, so that groups of tasks can once again be

		* Fixed data transfers to devices when in host mode
		* Renamed USB_DEV_OPT_HIGHSPEED to USB_DEV_OPT_FULLSPEED and USB_HOST_IsDeviceHighSpeed() to
		  USB_HOST_IsDeviceFullSpeed() to be in line with the official USB speed names (to avoid confusion with

	Version 1.2.0 - Released February 4th, 2008:
	--------------------------------------------
		* Added USB_DeviceEnumerationComplete event for host mode
		* Added new Scheduler_Init routine to preprepare the scheduler, so that tasks can be started and
		  stopped before the scheduler has been started (via Scheduler_Start)
		* Connection events in both Device and Host mode are now interrupt-driven, allowing the USB management
		  task to be stopped when the USB is not connected to a host or device
		* All demos updated to stop the USB task when not in use via the appropriate USB events
		* Mass Storage Host demo application updated to function correctly with all USB flash disks

		* Shifted error handling code in the host enum state machine to a single block, to reduce code complexity
		* Added in DESCRIPTOR_TYPE, DESCRIPTOR_SIZE and DESCRIPTOR_CAST macros to make config descriptor processing
		  clearer in USB hosts and DESCRIPTOR_ADDRESS for convenience in USB devices
		* Added in alloca macro to common.h, in case the user is using an old version of avr-lib-c missing the macro

		* Fixed incorrect device reset routine being called in USBTask
		* Devices which do not connect within the standard 300mS are now supported
		* Removed incorrect ATTR_PURE from Scheduler_SetTaskMode(), which was preventing tasks from being
		  started/stopped, as well as USB_InitTaskPointer(), which was breaking dual device/host USB projects
		* Changed scheduler to use the task name rather than IDs for setting the task mode, eliminating the
		  need to have a task ID list
		* ID transistion interrupt now raises the appropriate device/host disconnect event if device attached
		* Fixed double VBUS change (and VBUS -) event when detatching in device mode
