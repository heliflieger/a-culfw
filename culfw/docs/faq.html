<h2>CUL FAQ</h2>

<a href="#faq1">1. My CUL was initialized with <code>X01</code> or
<code>X09</code> to receive data  but there is no output at all.  I am sure
that there is traffic on air. CUL responds as expected to other commands like
<code>l</code> and <code>V</code>. Is my CUL defect?</a><br>

<ul>
Please check the response to command <code>C35</code>. Reception mode is turned on if the
return value is <code>13</code>. If reception mode is enabled but nothing is
received, the EEPROM data is probably corrupt. You can reinitialize the EEPROM
data with the default setting from program code by means of the command
<code>W01FFFF</code>.
