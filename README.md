##### Fork of a-culfw from heliflieger/a-culfw

<<<<<<< HEAD
#I2CCUL 	
- Allow communication over I2C as Slave instead UART
- based on nanoCUL board
- Pro Mini with 3,3V / 16MHz, 3,3V/8MHz or a Nano should also work

##ToDo:
- Addressing per Pin Assignment, not Software defined
- Code cleanups
- cleanup Protocol to MHz assignments
=======
SSCUL - Goal is to implement Software Serial Stacking for the nanoCUL - Works but has receive Problems because of SoftwareSerial Interrupts
>>>>>>> refs/remotes/origin/master

a644p - Works on an Atmel AVR 644p - with SCC support

I2CCUL - Allow communication over I2C as Slave instead UART - WIP
